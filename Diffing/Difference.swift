/* Splatting the collections into contiguous storage has two advantages:
 *
 * 1) Subscript access is much faster
 * 2) Subscript index becomes Int, matching the iterator types in the algorithm
 *
 * Combined, these effects dramatically improves performance when
 * collections differ significantly, without unduly degrading runtime when
 * the parameters are very similar.
 *
 * In terms of memory use, the linear cost of creating a ContiguousArray (when
 * necessary) is significantly less than the worst-case nÂ² memory use of the
 * descent algorithm.
